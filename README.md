# Simple-TR-Model

Welcome to the **Simple-TR-Model** project!  
This beginner-friendly TensorFlow project walks through building and training a basic neural network to predict simple linear relationships.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project introduces:
- **What are Tensors** — explained in a simple way.
- **How to build a Neural Network Model** — using `tf.keras.Sequential`.
- **Understanding Core Concepts**:
  - Layers (`Dense`)
  - Optimizers (`SGD`)
  - Loss Functions (`Mean Squared Error`)
  - Model Training and Prediction

The model learns a very simple relationship:  
> **y = 2x + 1**
